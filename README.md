# ListTradeSkills

## Origin
I was looking for an addon that would let people in my guild post their
tradeskills onto our phpbb3 based boards and found an addon called
ListTradeSkills written by Eric Shepherd

Good though this addon is, it didn't output the text in the format I 
needed for the boards so I hacked out the html code and added code to 
output the data in the form I needed.

This verison is meant for a specific use for my guild website. Although
you are welcome to use it I suggest that you look at the original first as I'd hope to one day
merge anything useful from here into that.

TODO: Find URL to quote for original version

## Usage
1. Install the addon as normal
2. Bring up the tradeskill window for the skill you want to list
3. Type /tsl into the chat window
4. Cut and paste the message that appears into a boards post using ctrl-a then ctrl-c to copy it in wow

 
## XML output
Use /tslx to get XML output
Use /tslb to get PHPBB output (for my board using the custom item tag)
