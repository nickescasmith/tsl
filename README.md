# ListTradeSkills

## Origin
I was looking for an addon that would let people in my guild post their
tradeskills onto our phpbb3 based boards and found an addon called
ListTradeSkills written by Eric Shepherd

Good though this addon is, it didn't output the text in the format I 
needed for the boards so I hacked out the html code and added code to 
output the data in the form I needed.

## Usage
1. Install the addon as normal
2. Bring up the tradeskill window for the skill you want to list
3. Type /lts into the chat window
4. Cut and paste the message that appears into a boards post using ctrl-a then ctrl-c to copy it in wow
